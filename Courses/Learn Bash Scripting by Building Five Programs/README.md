### 1. **Questionnaire**
   - **Objective:** Create an interactive script that executes a form question.
   - **Key Concepts:**
     - Creating and running Bash scripts.
     - Using variables to store data.
     - Reading user input.
     - Conditional statements (if-else).
     - Making a script executable.
     - Using the shebang (`#!/bin/bash`).
     - Basic echo commands with special options like `-e` for newline characters.

---

### 2. **Countdown**
   - **Objective:** Build a script that counts down from a specified number to zero.
   - **Key Concepts:**
     - Passing and handling script arguments.
     - Looping constructs (`for` and `while` loops).
     - Conditional testing with expressions.
     - Pausing execution with the `sleep` command.
     - Exit status of commands and how to check it (`$?`).
     - Arithmetic operations and comparisons within the script.

---

### 3. **Bingo**
   - **Objective:** Create a script that generates a random bingo number.
   - **Key Concepts:**
     - Using environment variables like `RANDOM` for generating random numbers.
     - Modulus operator for limiting random number ranges.
     - Complex conditional statements with `if`, `elif`, and `else`.
     - Associating conditions with specific outputs (e.g., Bingo letter and number).

---

### 4. **Fortune**
   - **Objective:** Develop a script that predicts a user's fortune.
   - **Key Concepts:**
     - Generating random outcomes based on user input or other conditions.
     - Advanced string manipulations and formatting.

---

### 5. **Last File**
   - **Objective:** Implement a simple game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.
   - **Key Concepts:**
     - Handling multiple user inputs.
     - Logic for game mechanics and determining the winner.
     - User interaction and feedback through the terminal.
