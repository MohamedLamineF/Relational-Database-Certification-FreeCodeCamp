# Learn SQL by Building a Student Database - Part 2 

This course will guide you through the fundamental concepts of SQL while you build and manipulate a database for managing student information, (Honestly, this part is kind of boring).

## Course Overview

### Part 1: Scripting with SQL
- **Creating and Running Scripts**: Learn to create and execute bash scripts that interact with your database.
- **Writing Queries in Scripts**: Embed SQL queries within your scripts to automate data retrieval and display.

### Part 2: SQL Query Basics
- **Selecting Data**: Practice retrieving specific columns and rows using `SELECT` and `WHERE` clauses.
- **Filtering Data**: Use various operators to filter data based on conditions.

### Part 3: Advanced Query Techniques
- **Pattern Matching**: Use `LIKE` and `ILIKE` for pattern matching in text fields.
- **Aggregating Data**: Utilize aggregate functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, and `MAX` to summarize data.
- **Grouping Data**: Apply `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` to group data and filter groups based on conditions.

### Part 4: Joining Tables
- **Types of Joins**: Explore different types of joins (`INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `FULL JOIN`) to combine data from multiple tables.
- **Complex Queries with Joins**: Build complex queries that involve multiple joins to get comprehensive results.

### Part 5: Advanced Data Retrieval
- **Subqueries and Nested Queries**: Write subqueries to break down complex queries into manageable parts.
- **Using Functions and Calculations**: Perform calculations and use functions within your SQL queries to manipulate and present data as needed.
- **Building a Student Information Script**: Create a comprehensive script that queries and displays various aspects of the student data, such as students' GPAs, courses they are enrolled in, and statistical summaries.
